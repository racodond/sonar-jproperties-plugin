  Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate effectively. This rule checks that all file names match a provided regular expression.
</p>
<p>As Java properties files are used in a large variety of ways and by many frameworks, it might sometimes be tricky to enforce a
  strict file naming convention. However, the default regular expression has been designed to match as closely as possible the
  following guidelines:
<ul>
<li>Suffix files with <code>.properties</code></li>
<li>Only use letters, digits and '_' characters</li>
<pre>
myProperties.p            # Noncompliant
my-properties.properties  # Noncompliant
</pre>
<li>Refrain from using '_' characters. Only use them when mandatory such as in i18n Java resource bundles.</li>
<li>Extensively use Camel Case. For example, prefer:
<pre>
myProperties.properties
</pre>
to
<pre>
myproperties.properties
my_properties.properties
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
