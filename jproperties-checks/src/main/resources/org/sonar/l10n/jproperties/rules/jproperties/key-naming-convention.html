<p>Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently. This rule checks that all keys match a provided
    regular expression.</p>
<p>As Java properties files are used in a large variety of ways and by many frameworks, it might sometimes be tricky to enforce a
    strict key naming convention. However, the default regular expression has been designed to match as closely as possible the
    following guidelines:
<ul>
<li>Only use letters, digits and '.' characters</li>
<pre>
bank-account-number=123456   # Noncompliant
bank_account_owner=John Doe  # Noncompliant
</pre>
<li>Follow OOP concept as much as possible. For example, prefer:
<pre>
bank.account.number=123456
bank.account.owner=John Doe
</pre>
to
<pre>
bankAccountNumber=123456
bankAccountOwner=John Doe
</pre>
</li>
<li>Whenever possible, use lowercase characters. For example, prefer:</li>
<pre>
bank.account.number=123456
bank.account.owner=John Doe
</pre>
to
<pre>
Bank.Account.Number=123456
Bank.Account.Owner=John Doe
</pre>
But keep it readable. For example, prefer:
<pre>
font.timesNewRoman.size=10
</pre>
to
<pre>
font.timesnewroman.size=10
</pre>
</ul>
</p>
